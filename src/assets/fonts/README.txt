The SRG SSR fonts were renamed by the vendor in version 2.100. The new names are:
SRGSSR Type Display --> SRGSSR Type
SRGSSR Type Text    --> SRGSSR Text

Accordingly, the SRG SSR text font was renamed by the vendor in version 2.100 to:
SRGSSRTextVF_W_Wght.woff2

And the SRG SSR display font was renamed to:
SRGSSRTypeVF_W_Wght.woff2

For compatibility reasons, we kept the old names from version 2.000 (which,
unfortunately, might be a little bit confusing):

| Font           | File name in Feathers             | Vendor file name          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| SRGSSR Text VF | SRGSSRTypeVF_Text_W_Wght.woff2    | SRGSSRTextVF_W_Wght.woff2 |
| SRGSSR Type VF | SRGSSRTypeVF_Display_W_Wght.woff2 | SRGSSRTypeVF_W_Wght.woff2 |
