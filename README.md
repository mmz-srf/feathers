Shared Frontend Components for SRF applications

- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) enabling testing of the components

## Development

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

## Publishing

`srf-feathers` is published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/srf-feathers). A github workflow is used to auto-publish on NPM when the version number in `package.json` is increased on the master branch.

In case this fails, publish via `npm publish` (you must be logged into npm in the CLI).

### Generating New Components

I've included a handy NodeJS util file under `util` called `create-component.js`. Instead of copy pasting components to create a new component, you can instead run this command to generate all the files you need to start building out a new component. To use it:

```
npm run generate YourComponentName
```

This will generate:

```
/src
  /YourComponentName
    YourComponentName.tsx
    YourComponentName.stories.tsx
    YourComponentName.test.tsx
    YourComponentName.types.ts
    YourComponentName.scss
```

The default templates for each file can be modified under `util/templates`.

Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!

## Additional Help

### Component Code Splitting

Code splitting of your components is not supported by default.

[Read this section of my blog post](https://blog.harveydelaney.com/creating-your-own-react-component-library/#introducing-code-splitting-optional-) to find out how and why you would enable code splitting of your components. In summary, code splitting enables users to import components in isolation like:

```
import TestComponent from 'harvey-component-library/build/TestComponent';
```

This can reduce the bundle size for projects using older (CJS) module formats.

You can check out [this branch](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/tree/code-splitting) or [this commit](https://github.com/HarveyD/react-component-library/commit/94631be5a871f3b39dbc3e9bd3e75a8ae5b3b759) to see what changes are neccesary to implement it.

Please note, there's an issue with code splitting and using `rollup-plugin-postcss`. I recommend using `rollup-plugin-sass` instead alongside code splitting.
