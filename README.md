Shared Frontend Components for SRF applications

- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) enabling testing of the components

## Usage

Run `npm install srf-feathers --save` in your project root.

Import and use components in your code:

```js
import { Button } from "srf-feathers";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <Button />
  </div>
);

```

## Development

### Installation

* check out srf-feathers `git clone git@github.com:mmz-srf/feathers.git`
* enter directory where you installed it, e.g. `cd feathers`
* install dependencies `npm install`

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you have to update the _secrets_ (e.g. `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` for deployment to chromatic or `NPM_TOKEN` for deploying on NPM), you can change them on https://github.com/mmz-srf/feathers/settings/secrets/actions 

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

## Publishing

`srf-feathers` is published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/srf-feathers). A github workflow is used to auto-publish on NPM when the version number in `package.json` is increased on the master branch.

In case this fails, publish via `npm publish` (you must be logged into npm in the CLI).

### Generating New Components

There is a handy NodeJS util file under `util` called `create-component.js`. Instead of copy pasting components to create a new component, you can instead run this command to generate all the files you need to start building out a new component. To use it:

```
npm run generate YourComponentName
```

This will generate:

```
/src
  /YourComponentName
    YourComponentName.tsx
    YourComponentName.stories.tsx
    YourComponentName.test.tsx
    YourComponentName.types.ts
    YourComponentName.scss
```

The default templates for each file can be modified under `util/templates`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!**

## Additional Help

### Install local version of feathers in your project

While developing, it is useful to not have to publish every little change to NPM before you can use it in your project.
For this, it's possible to "install" a local version of srf-feathers in your project with

```
npm i --save relative/path/to/feathers/repo
```

If, for example, your project's repository is in the same folder you checked out srf-feather, you can run the following command in your project's root folder:

```
npm i --save ../feathers
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you've previously installed srf-feathers via NPM, you might have to remove the folder in your `node_modules`.

### dev-tools (feathers-dev)

For a smoother experience, a collection of the most used commands has been added to a dev-script in `/bin/feathers-dev`. List the available commands with

```
./bin/feathers-dev help 
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Pro tip: add `alias feathers-dev='path/to/feathers/bin/feathers-dev'` to your `~/.zshrc` or equivalent to be able to type `feathers-dev`!
